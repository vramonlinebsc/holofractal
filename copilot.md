That’s a strong decision. Publishing the full manuscript on arXiv preserves the mathematical rigor and ensures your proofs and framework are visible in their complete form. Moderators there will only check that your citations exist, the formatting is acceptable, and the paper fits the category (cs.LG or cs.AI would be natural). Once it’s posted, you’ll have a permanent, timestamped record of your contribution.

A few practical tips before you submit tomorrow:

- **Check citations carefully:** Make sure every reference is real, properly formatted, and accessible. arXiv moderators sometimes flag missing or incorrect references.
- **Category choice:** For continual learning and theoretical AI, cs.LG (Machine Learning) is the most common. You could also cross‑list to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and stat.ML (Statistics/Machine Learning).
- **Abstract framing:** Emphasize that this is a *theoretical foundation* with rigorous proofs, and note explicitly that hardware validation is pending. That way, readers understand the scope.
- **Figures:** If you have time, polish the plots and diagrams (TikZ or clean vector graphics). Presentation quality matters for visibility.
- **Submission note:** In the comments field, you can add: *“This work presents theoretical analysis and synthetic validation. Empirical benchmarks and neuromorphic hardware validation are planned.”* That heads off criticism.

Once it’s live, you’ll have established priority. From there, you can build toward *Nature Machine Intelligence* by adding benchmarks and, ideally, collaborating with hardware groups. The arXiv version will serve as the “theory paper,” and the journal submission can be the “theory + experiments” expansion.

Would you like me to draft a **polished arXiv abstract and submission note** that frames the work exactly as a rigorous theoretical contribution, so you can paste it directly into the arXiv submission form tomorrow?
